## spock
Spock is an application that allows professors to better organize online classes. This is especially important in a world where viruses are mutating and
making in-person classes hard or impossible to conduct. Given that Spock evolves, it is very possible that Spock could be a very useful tool for professors
in the future if another lockdown happens as it did in 2020. Because of this, it could be argued that working on Spock contributed to the good old "common good" of
the community here at St. Thomas.

On the Spock application, I touched two distinct areas. The first was the development of the settings functionality. In this segment of the application I got
experience working with a lot of the functions of Spring, Hibernate, and JSP on the frontend. The second area of the application that I worked on was the 
attendance functionality. I worked with a team member on this feature to plan and develop it. This was a valuable experience because it showed how important
communication is when two people are working on a system where changes on person makes may render the other person's code not functional.
